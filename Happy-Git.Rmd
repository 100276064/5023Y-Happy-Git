# Why Git? 

Two reasons that we'll be most interested in (to start):

- It's a great way to safely store organized versions of a project

- It's ideal for data science collaborators who need to share & edit code together

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3jLJU7DT5E) *before* or *after* today's session


## Some notes:
 
Repositories (repos) on GitHub are the same unit as an RStudio Project - it's a place where you can easily store all information/data/etc. related to whatever project you're working on.
 
When we create a Repository in GitHub and have it communicating with a Project in RStudio, then we can get (**pull**) information from GitHub to RStudio, or **push** information from RStudio to GitHub where it is safely stored and/or our collaborators can access it. It also keeps a *complete history* of updated versions that can be accessed/reviewed by you and your collaborators at any time, from anywhere, as long as you have the internet.

A couple of general tips:
 
- Pull frequently (if working with anyone else, and when you start working on a project again, even if on the same device)

- Commit/push in small, meaningful increments and with useful (searchable, descriptive) Commit messages

- The best way to deal with merge conflicts is to avoid creating merge conflicts. This is what happens when two people pull a version, work on it separately and then try to push back to the repo *at the same time* Communicate with collaborators so you’re not all working on the same piece of code at the same time.

# Exercises

**PART 1.** Fork & Clone an existing repo

**PART 2.** Create your own repo and version controlled R project from scratch

**PART 3.** Use the GitHub Classroom to fork a project, organise folders, run a script 

**END** Make sure you complete this worksheet it will be vital for submitting your second summative assignment. 


## Learning outcomes

- Become a master of reproducible research & version control with GitHub

- Improve project structure

- Write informative notes for collaborators & archiving


# PART 1. Fork & clone an existing repo on GitHub, make edits, push back

a. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and log in (you need your own account - for sign up with your uea.ac.uk e-mail)

b. In the Search bar, look for repo **Philip-Leftwich/5023Y-Happy-Git**

c. Click on the repo name, and look at the existing repo structure

d. **FORK** the repo

e. Press Clone/download, copy the URL, and create a new project from Git repository in RStudio (add your URL) 
(*Note* you may be asked to enable Git and/or asked to provide your GitHub username and password)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

```{r github, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Gitimg.png")
```


```{r cloud, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/Rstudio_cloud.png")
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

f. Open the some_cool_animals.Rmd document, and the accompanying html 

g. Add *your name* to the top of the document

h. BUT WAIT. We have forgotten to add a great image and facts about a very important species - Baby Yoda, including an image 


## FACTS

```{r Grogu, echo=FALSE, out.width= "35%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("some cool animals/Grogu.jpg")
```

- Also known as "The Child"

- likes unfertilised frog eggs & control knobs

- strong with the force

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


i. Once you’ve added Grogu, knit the Rmd document to update the html

j. Stage, Commit & Push all files 

Staged - pick those files which you intend to bind to a commit

Commit - write a short descriptive message, binds changes to a single commit

Push - "Pushes" your changes from the local repo to the remote repo on GitHub. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>

k. On GitHub, refresh and see that files are updated. Cool! Now you’ve used something someone else has created, customized it, and saved your updated version. 


# PART 2. Create your own repo & version controlled R Project from scratch


## "But I forgot how to code over Christmas!!!"

Today we will have a bit of a play with tidyverse tools and plotting to refresh your memory! 

Remember if your code doesn't run, it is usually a simple fix. Read the error message carefully and see how many of these bingo tiles you can pick up!

```{r debug, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/debugging_bingo.jpg")
```

a. Go back to your GitHub account

b. Click on the plus sign (upper right, by your profile pic/icon) to create a new repository

c. Name the repo 5023Y-second-repo-yourinitials (like 5023Y-second-repo-PL), and select to initialize with a ReadMe

d. Edit the ReadMe (however you want - notice that markdown formatting works & you can see a preview) & commit

Some tips: 

Include a title, introduction/objectives


e. Clone to create a connected R Project in RStudio

f. Create a new R Markdown document

g. Attach the {tidyverse},{palmerpenguins} and {plotly} packages in a hidden code chunk (include = FALSE)

h. Create an interactive plot of PalmerPenguins with {plotly}, showing the output but **not** the code or messages

```{r}
penguin_graph <- ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = body_mass_g, 
                 color = species),
             alpha = 0.4) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("purple","orange","black")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "bill length (mm)",
       y = "bill depth mm",
       title = "Penguin measurements")

ggplotly(penguin_graph, tooltip = c("species"))
```




i. Knit & save your .Rmd

j. Stage, commit & push back to GitHub


# PART 3. GitHub Classroom enabled R Projects with subfolders

BLURB ON CLASSROOM

a. Follow this [invite link](https://classroom.github.com/a/JS2r62wD)

b. You will be invited to sign-in to Github (if not already) & to join the UEABIO organisation

c. Clone your assignment to work locally in RStudio

d. In your local project folder, create subfolders ‘data’ and ‘final_graphs’ (**Note** use the dir.create commands in the console)

e. Drop the file disease_burden.csv into the ‘data’ subfolder (**Note** unlike in Bash there is no base R command to move files so do this using the RStudio pane)

f. Open a new .R script

g. Attach the {tidyverse} and {janitor} package

h. Read in the disease_burden.csv data

This is a file look at the death rate for every country in the world across four decades.

i. Stage, commit & push at this point - notice that the empty folder ‘final_graphs’ doesn’t show up (won’t commit an empty folder)

j. Back in the script, write a short script to read and clean the data. 

Use %>% and `filter` to pull out "United States", "Japan", "Afghanistan"& "Somalia"

We want to look at death for both sexes at 0-6 days so use filter here as well.

Assign this to a new object 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

db <- read_csv("data/disease_burden.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(deaths_per_100k = death_rate_per_100_000)

# View(db)

# Subset (US, Japan = lowest infant death rates, Afghanistan = highest infant death rates)

db_sub <- db %>%
  filter(country_name %in% c("United States", "Japan", "Afghanistan", "Somalia")) %>%
  filter(age_group == "0-6 days", sex == "Both")
```


k. Make a ggplot plotting the deaths per 100K by country across the four decades

HINT - use geom_line() and remember to separate countries by colour


```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = db_sub) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year,
                 y = deaths_per_100k,
                 color = country_name)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "blue", "magenta", "orange"))

```


l. Update your graph with direct labels (using `annotate`) and vertical or horizontal lines with `geom_vline` or `geom_hline`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Graph
# New things: annotation + vertical line

ggplot(data = db_sub) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year,
                 y = deaths_per_100k,
                 color = country_name)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black", "blue", "magenta", "orange")) +
  annotate(geom = "text",
           x = 1985,
           y = 2.2e5,
           label = "Afghanistan",
           size = 2.5) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2000,
             lty = 2) +
  theme_minimal()


```

```{r disease-graph, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/disease_graph.png")
```

m. Use ggsave() to write your graph to a .png in the ‘final_graphs’ subfolder


```{r eval=FALSE}
ggsave(("final_graphs/disease_graph.png"), width = 5, height = 3)
```

n. Save, stage, commit & push 

o. Check that changes are stored on GitHub


(**NOTE** this will be in your organisations rather than repos)
